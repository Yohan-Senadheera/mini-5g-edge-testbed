# mini-5g-edge-testbed
A 5G-inspired, cloud-native networking testbed showcasing containerized network functions, edge-style deployment on Linux, automation-ready workflows (CI/CD → Kubernetes/AWS roadmap), and real-time observability with Prometheus/Grafana. Focuses on cloud-native NF + edge principles, not radio-level 5G.
